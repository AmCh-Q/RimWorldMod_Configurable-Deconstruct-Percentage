  <description>In the vanilla game, deconstructions return 50% of the used building materials, this mod makes it configurable (100% by default).

No reload required upon setting change as it takes effect immediately.

This is my take on basically the same function as Neceros' [99 Percent] Mod ( https://github.com/Neceros/99percent , https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1267149586 ) since they are no longer maintaing their mods.
I took their idea but not their codes as this is a C# rewrite that adds configurability.

This is my second C# mod, let me know if you notice any incompatibilities.</description>
